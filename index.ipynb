    "What is grokking? [Grokking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.02177.pdf) is a curious phenomenon in neural networks. It in some sense spits in the face of classic understanding of training models. Rather than describe it, as they say, a picture is worth 1,000 words.\n",

    "## Its not actually that bad!\n",
    "Okay, so 4 orders of magnitude seem completely untenable, but this was the worst case described in the paper. Lets talk about the problem discussed in the paper a bit.\n",
